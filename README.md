# Fashion Retail Store: Individual District Manager Performance Analysis | Power BI
I developed an interactive Power BI report that analyzes and tracks the performance of individual district managers by comparing their current yearâ€™s sales to their assigned sales goals. This report provides a comprehensive, data-driven approach to understanding sales trends, store performance, and regional variations, helping businesses make strategic decisions to improve revenue and efficiency.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Details  
- **Tool Used:** Power BI

- **Objective:** Analyzing district managers' performance, sales trends, and regional performance across different stores.  

## Key Data Fields:
> - District Manager Name
> - Store Name & ID

## Descriptive Analysis Questions:
1. What is the total sales achieved vs. the total sales goal for the current year?

## Process:
- Loaded the data to Power BI and transformed: Checked for missing values, duplicates and cleaned the data.

- Created Dropdown Filters to allow users to select a specific district manager to view tailored data.
- Displayed KPI cards to Show total sales, sales goals and an indicator to identify whether 
the goal has been achieved.
- Made a Monthly Sales Trend Chart (Line Chart) that displays sales progression over time, comparing actual sales vs. sales goals to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and deviations from targets.
- Created a Sales by Store Bar Chart to Compares each storeâ€™s actual sales against their respective goals, helping to evaluate store-specific performance and identify top-performing or underperforming locations.
